# Good to know

+ Written against LÖVE `11.2`.
+ Makes heavy use of the LÖVE physics module.
+ The table editor uses the [Love Frames library by KennyShields](https://github.com/linux-man/LoveFrames), currently maintained by [linux-man](https://github.com/linux-man/).
+ Powered by kittens.
+ `main.lua` is an example pinball game that shows how to get up and running.

# Running the example

- Copy init.lua into the `example` directory
- Run `love --console .` from within the example directory
- Left/Right shift controls the flippers. Spacebar releases more balls.
